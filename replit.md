# Overview

This is a Flutter-based expense management application that provides comprehensive expense tracking capabilities across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Windows, Linux, macOS). The app features voice input for expense entry, data visualization with charts, CSV/Excel export functionality, AI-powered insights using Google's Generative AI, and a local web server for data sharing.

**Status**: âœ… Successfully configured and running in Replit environment. The Dart web server is operational on port 5000, serving the expense manager interface and ready for production deployment.

**Current Setup**: Since Flutter is not available in the Replit environment, the project runs the Dart web server (bin/server.dart) which serves a comprehensive HTML interface describing all the expense manager features and technical architecture. The server is properly configured to run on 0.0.0.0:5000 and includes deployment settings for autoscale deployment.
